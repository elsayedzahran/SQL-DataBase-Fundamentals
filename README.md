# DataBase
It is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient 
retrieval, manipulation, and management of information.
## Why to use DB over normal files?
 ### a) Data Integrity and Consistency
Databases provide mechanisms for defining constraints and rules that ensure data integrity and consistency. Constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints prevent the insertion of duplicate or inconsistent data.
 ### b) Indexing 
Databases utilize indexes to speed up data retrieval operations, making queries more efficient, even with large datasets.
 ### c) Data Relationships and Joins 
Databases support the establishment of relationships between tables through foreign keys.
 ### d) Data Backup and Recovery
Databases often offer built-in backup and recovery features, ensuring that critical data is protected from loss due to hardware failures, accidental deletions, or disasters.
 ### e) Data Security
Databases offer built-in security features that allow administrators to control access to the data at different levels.
# Database componenets
## 1- Schema
The database schema defines the structure of the database, including the tables, their columns, Views and Procedures, It acts as a blueprint for organizing the data.
## 2- Tables
Data in a database is organized into tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each row represents a single record or data entry, and each column represents a specific attribute or field of the data.
